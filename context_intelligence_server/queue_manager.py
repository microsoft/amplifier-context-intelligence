"""On-disk durable queue manager for the event-write pipeline.

Disk layout (one set of files per session, keyed by ``session_id``):

- ``<session_id>.log`` — append-only, newline-terminated, opaque ``bytes``.
  Each line is one enqueued record. The log is never rewritten in place.
- ``<session_id>.offset`` — a single integer: the byte position in the log
  that has been durably processed (committed). A missing offset file means 0.
- ``<session_id>.dead.jsonl`` — append-only dead-letter records for batches
  that could not be processed after exhausting retries.

Durability note:
    Appends use a plain durable ``write()``. This gives PROCESS-crash
    durability (the bytes are handed to the OS page cache and survive a
    process crash). POWER-LOSS durability via ``fsync`` is deliberately
    deferred to Phase B3 (fsync group-commit).

session_id contract:
    Every public method validates ``session_id`` and raises ``ValueError`` if
    it is empty or contains a path separator (``/`` or ``\\``) or a null byte.
    The ``session_id`` is used raw as the filename stem, so it must be a safe,
    single path component.
