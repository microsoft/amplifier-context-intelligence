# Context Intelligence Graph Query (Cypher Dialect)

This skill teaches how to query the context-intelligence property graph using
the `graph_query` tool. All structural traversal — sessions, events, tool calls,
delegations — is done through Cypher queries executed via the
`graph_query` tool.

Query patterns for searching and traversing the context-intelligence graph.
Covers workspace scoping, structural traversal, delegation chains, step
sequencing, and graph algorithm patterns using native Cypher.

---

## When to Use Graph vs File Patterns

Choose the right approach based on what you need to find:

| Query Type | Tool | Example |
|-----------|------|---------|
| Structural navigation (sessions, events, tool calls, delegations) | `graph_query` | "Find all tool calls in this session" |
| Relationship traversal (parent-child, HAS_FORK, HAS_TOOL_CALL) | `graph_query` | "Find all child sessions" |
| Session statistics and aggregations | `graph_query` | "Count tool calls by tool name" |
| Prompt text keyword search | `bash`+`grep` or `graph_query` | "Find prompts containing 'authentication'" |
| Large payload inspection (messages, results) | `bash`+`jq` after `blob_read` | "Read tool result JSON" |
| Event log text search across sessions | `bash`+`grep` on events.jsonl | "Find all sessions with a specific error" |

**Fallback guidance:** If `graph_query` returns no results, fall back to
`bash`+`grep`/`jq` on the raw events.jsonl file — the graph may not have
been populated yet for in-progress sessions.

## Schema Reference — Data Layer 1

> **Scope:** This section describes **Data Layer 1** — the only schema that is actually
> implemented and queryable today. See the [Data Layer 2 Warning](#data-layer-2-warning)
> section before writing any Cypher queries.

### Node Types

Data Layer 1 contains exactly **three** node types.

| Node Label | Sub-labels | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `:Session` | `:RootSession` — no parent; `:ForkedSession` — spawned via `session:fork` | One Amplifier session. MERGE key: `{node_id, workspace}`. |
| `:ToolCall` | _(none)_ | One tool invocation lifecycle (pre → post/error). Created by `ToolCallHandler` on `tool:pre`. |
| `:Event` | `:{Category}Event`, `:{Specific}Event` — see Triple-Label Rule below | Every event that reaches `DefaultHandler`. Triple-labeled. |

---

### Edge Types

Data Layer 1 contains exactly **three** edge types.

| Edge | From → To | When Created |
|---|---|---|
| `HAS_FORK` | `:Session` → `:Session` | On `session:fork` — parent session → forked child. |
| `HAS_TOOL_CALL` | `:Session` → `:ToolCall` | On `tool:pre` — session owns the tool call lifecycle node. |
| `HAS_EVENT` | `:Session` → `:Event` | On every `DefaultHandler` event — session owns the event node. |
| `HAS_EVENT` | `:ToolCall` → `:Event` | On `tool:pre`, `tool:post`, `tool:error` — tool call owns each lifecycle event. |

---

### Event Triple-Label Rule

Every `Event` node carries exactly **three** labels derived from the raw event name
by `DefaultHandler.derive_labels()`:

1. **Base label** — always `:Event`
2. **Category label** — `:{Category}Event` (prefix before the last `:`, PascalCased)
3. **Specific label** — `:{Full}Event` (all parts split on `:` and `_`, PascalCased, `Event` suffix)

The full table of 24 known event types:

| Event Name | Category Label | Specific Label |
|---|---|---|
| `session:start` | `:SessionEvent` | `:SessionStartEvent` |
| `session:fork` | `:SessionEvent` | `:SessionForkEvent` |
| `session:end` | `:SessionEvent` | `:SessionEndEvent` |
| `session:resume` | `:SessionEvent` | `:SessionResumeEvent` |
| `execution:start` | `:ExecutionEvent` | `:ExecutionStartEvent` |
| `execution:end` | `:ExecutionEvent` | `:ExecutionEndEvent` |
| `orchestrator:complete` | `:OrchestratorEvent` | `:OrchestratorCompleteEvent` |
| `prompt:submit` | `:PromptEvent` | `:PromptSubmitEvent` |
| `prompt:complete` | `:PromptEvent` | `:PromptCompleteEvent` |
| `provider:request` | `:ProviderEvent` | `:ProviderRequestEvent` |
| `provider:response` | `:ProviderEvent` | `:ProviderResponseEvent` |
| `llm:request` | `:LlmEvent` | `:LlmRequestEvent` |
| `llm:response` | `:LlmEvent` | `:LlmResponseEvent` |
| `tool:pre` | `:ToolEvent` | `:ToolPreEvent` |
| `tool:post` | `:ToolEvent` | `:ToolPostEvent` |
| `tool:error` | `:ToolEvent` | `:ToolErrorEvent` |
| `delegate:start` | `:DelegateEvent` | `:DelegateStartEvent` |
| `delegate:agent_spawned` | `:DelegateEvent` | `:DelegateAgentSpawnedEvent` |
| `delegate:complete` | `:DelegateEvent` | `:DelegateCompleteEvent` |
| `recipe:start` | `:RecipeEvent` | `:RecipeStartEvent` |
| `recipe:step` | `:RecipeEvent` | `:RecipeStepEvent` |
| `recipe:complete` | `:RecipeEvent` | `:RecipeCompleteEvent` |
| `recipe:loop_iteration` | `:RecipeEvent` | `:RecipeLoopIterationEvent` |
| `skill:load` | `:SkillEvent` | `:SkillLoadEvent` |

Unknown events follow the same derivation automatically. Use `:Event` as the base
label when querying across all event types.

---

### FieldLifter Properties

`DefaultHandler` applies all matching `FieldLifter` instances to expose structured
fields as top-level node properties on every `:Event` node. All lifters fire (not
first-match-wins); specific lifters can override Universal.

| Lifter | Applies To (pattern) | Lifted Properties |
|---|---|---|
| `UniversalLifter` | `*` (all events) | `session_id`, `parent_id` |
| `ToolLifter` | `tool:*` | `tool_name`, `tool_input`, `tool_call_id`, `parallel_group_id` |
| `LlmLifter` | `llm:*` | `model`, `provider` |
| `DelegateLifter` | `delegate:*` | `agent`, `sub_session_id`, `parent_session_id`, `tool_call_id`, `parallel_group_id` |
| `PromptLifter` | `prompt:*` | `prompt`, `response_preview` |
| `RecipeLifter` | `recipe:*` | `recipe_name`, `current_step`, `description`, `status`, `step_id`, `total_steps` |
| `SessionLifter` | `session:*` | `parent`; from `metadata` dict: `agent_name`, `tool_call_id`, `parallel_group_id`, `recipe_name`, `recipe_step`, `recipe_step_index` |
| `SkillLifter` | `skill:*` | `skill_directory`, `skill_name` |
| `ArtifactLifter` | `artifact:*` | `bytes`, `path` |

`None` values and missing keys are silently skipped. `data` (full JSON payload) is
always written as a fallback, but prefer lifted properties for structured access.

---

### Data Layer 2 Warning

> ⚠️ **Do not write queries using any of the following labels or relationships.**
> They are either stub labels with no connected edges, or relationship types that
> do not exist in the graph. Queries referencing them will silently return no results.

**Labels That Exist But Have No Connected Edges:**

The following node labels may appear as orphan nodes in the database but are not
connected to the rest of the graph via any traversable relationship:

- `OrchestratorRun`
- `Step`
- `ToolExecution`
- `Delegation`
- `RecipeRun`

These are Data Layer 2 concepts that were planned but whose edge relationships
were never implemented. **Do not write queries that traverse to or from these labels.**

**Relationship Types That Do Not Exist:**

The following relationship types are referenced in older documentation or planning
documents but are **not present** in the graph:

- `HAS_RUN`
- `HAS_STEP`
- `TRIGGERED`
- `PARALLEL_WITH`
- `NEXT`

**Do not write queries using any of these relationship types.** They will match
nothing and silently produce empty result sets with no error.

---

### Node ID Formats

| Node Type | Format | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `:Session` (root) | Raw UUID | `f881e0a0-c055-4ee4-84ed-ff44703150ea` |
| `:Session` (forked) | `{hex}-{hex}_{agent-name}` | `a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890_foundation:explorer` |
| `:Event` | `{session_id}__{event_name_underscored}__{epoch_ms}` | `f881e0a0-...__tool_pre__1742018545123` |
| `:ToolCall` | `{session_id}__tool_call__{tool_call_id}` | `f881e0a0-...__tool_call__call_abc123` |

**Separator:** Double underscore `__` — never a single colon.
**`event_name_underscored`:** Raw event name with `:` replaced by `_` (e.g. `tool:pre` → `tool_pre`).
**`epoch_ms`:** Unix epoch milliseconds from the ISO 8601 timestamp.
**Disambiguator:** `tool_call_id` is appended to Event node IDs for tool lifecycle events to prevent collisions when parallel calls share the same millisecond timestamp.

---

### Two Paths to Tool Data

There are two complementary ways to query tool call information:

| Path | Pattern | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| **Flexible** — via Event | `(s:Session)-[:HAS_EVENT]->(e:ToolEvent)` | Filtering by tool name, reading lifted fields, querying all tool activity regardless of lifecycle state |
| **Structured** — via ToolCall | `(s:Session)-[:HAS_TOOL_CALL]->(tc:ToolCall)` | Getting the lifecycle node (start + end times), correlating pre/post/error events via `(tc)-[:HAS_EVENT]->(e)` |

The `:ToolCall` node provides:
- `tool_name` — the tool being called
- `tool_call_id` — provider-assigned correlation ID
- `session_id` — owning session
- `parallel_group_id` — set when the call is part of a parallel group
- `started_at` / `ended_at` — lifecycle timestamps (from `tool:pre` and `tool:post`/`tool:error`)

Both paths are valid. Use the flexible path for event-level queries; use the
structured path when you need the lifecycle view or duration calculations.

---

## Workspace Scoping

Every query is scoped to a **workspace** — an isolated partition identified
by the `workspace` property present on all nodes and relationships.

The `graph_query` tool handles automatic injection of the `$workspace`
parameter. When querying within the current workspace, the tool injects
the workspace value for you. Write Cypher queries that reference `$workspace`
explicitly in node patterns or WHERE clauses.

### 1. Default query (own workspace)

The `graph_query` tool auto-injects `$workspace` from the current session
context. Write queries that filter on `$workspace`:

```cypher
// $workspace auto-injected by graph_query tool
MATCH (s:Session {workspace: $workspace})
RETURN s.node_id, s.occurred_at
ORDER BY s.occurred_at DESC
```

### 2. Explicit workspace query

Pass `workspace="other-project"` to target a specific workspace:

```cypher
MATCH (s:Session {workspace: $workspace})
RETURN s.node_id, s.occurred_at
```

### 3. Cross-workspace (wildcard) query

Pass `workspace="*"` — the tool skips parameter injection entirely.
Write queries without `$workspace` filter, or add your own:

```cypher
// workspace="*" — no automatic injection
MATCH (s:Session)
RETURN s.workspace, s.node_id, s.occurred_at
ORDER BY s.workspace, s.occurred_at DESC
```

---

## Query Patterns

### Pattern 1: Find All Sessions in a Workspace

```cypher
MATCH (s:Session {workspace: $workspace})
RETURN s.node_id       AS session_id,
       s.occurred_at   AS started_at,
       labels(s)       AS session_labels
ORDER BY s.occurred_at DESC
```

To restrict to only top-level (root) sessions:

```cypher
MATCH (s:Session:RootSession {workspace: $workspace})
RETURN s.node_id AS session_id, s.started_at AS started_at
ORDER BY s.started_at DESC
```

### Pattern 2: Session Execution Brackets

Find all execution brackets (one per user turn):

```cypher
MATCH (s:Session {workspace: $workspace, node_id: $session_id})-[:HAS_EVENT]->(e:ExecutionStartEvent)
RETURN e.node_id AS bracket_id, e.occurred_at AS turn_started
ORDER BY e.occurred_at
```

Brackets with duration (pair each start with its nearest end):

```cypher
MATCH (s:Session {workspace: $workspace, node_id: $session_id})-[:HAS_EVENT]->(start:ExecutionStartEvent)
OPTIONAL MATCH (s)-[:HAS_EVENT]->(end:ExecutionEndEvent)
WHERE end.occurred_at > start.occurred_at
WITH start, min(end.occurred_at) AS turn_ended
RETURN start.node_id AS bracket_id,
       start.occurred_at AS turn_started,
       turn_ended,
       duration.between(datetime(start.occurred_at), datetime(turn_ended)) AS duration
ORDER BY start.occurred_at
```

### Pattern 3: Session Event Timeline

Complete chronological event timeline for a session:

```cypher
MATCH (s:Session {workspace: $workspace, node_id: $session_id})-[:HAS_EVENT]->(e:Event)
RETURN e.event_name, labels(e), e.occurred_at
ORDER BY e.occurred_at
```

Filter to a specific event category (e.g., LLM events only):

```cypher
MATCH (s:Session {workspace: $workspace, node_id: $session_id})-[:HAS_EVENT]->(e:LlmEvent)
RETURN e.event_name, e.model, e.occurred_at
ORDER BY e.occurred_at
```

### Pattern 4: Session Tool Activity

There are two complementary paths to tool data in Data Layer 1. Use the **flexible
path** (via `:ToolEvent`) for search and analysis — it lets you filter by tool name,
read lifted fields, and query all tool activity regardless of lifecycle state. Use the
**structured path** (via `:ToolCall`) when the lifecycle node itself is the natural
anchor — for example, when you need start + end timestamps or want to correlate
pre/post/error events via `(tc)-[:HAS_EVENT]->(e)`.

**Variant 1 — Flexible path (preferred for search and analysis):**

```cypher
MATCH (s:Session {workspace: $workspace, node_id: $session_id})-[:HAS_EVENT]->(e:ToolEvent)
RETURN e.event_name AS event_type,
       e.tool_name,
       e.tool_call_id,
       e.parallel_group_id,
       e.occurred_at
ORDER BY e.occurred_at
```

**Variant 2 — Filter to tool:pre only:**

```cypher
MATCH (s:Session {workspace: $workspace, node_id: $session_id})-[:HAS_EVENT]->(e:ToolPreEvent)
RETURN e.tool_name,
       e.tool_call_id,
       e.occurred_at
```

**Variant 3 — Structured path (when ToolCall is the anchor):**

```cypher
MATCH (s:Session {workspace: $workspace, node_id: $session_id})-[:HAS_TOOL_CALL]->(tc:ToolCall)
RETURN tc.tool_name,
       tc.tool_call_id,
       tc.parallel_group_id,
       tc.ended_at
ORDER BY tc.ended_at
```

### Pattern 5: Child Sessions and Delegation Metadata

**Variant 1 — Direct child sessions (structural, via HAS_FORK):**

```cypher
MATCH (parent:Session {workspace: $workspace, node_id: $session_id})-[:HAS_FORK]->(child:Session)
RETURN child.node_id    AS child_session_id,
       child.started_at AS started_at,
       labels(child)    AS session_labels
ORDER BY child.started_at
```

**Variant 2 — Delegation metadata (via DelegateAgentSpawnedEvent):**

```cypher
MATCH (parent:Session {workspace: $workspace, node_id: $session_id})-[:HAS_EVENT]->(e:DelegateAgentSpawnedEvent)
RETURN e.agent            AS agent,
       e.sub_session_id   AS sub_session_id,
       e.tool_call_id     AS tool_call_id,
       e.parallel_group_id AS parallel_group_id,
       e.occurred_at      AS occurred_at
ORDER BY e.occurred_at
```

**Variant 3 — Combined (structural children with delegation metadata):**

```cypher
MATCH (parent:Session {workspace: $workspace, node_id: $session_id})-[:HAS_FORK]->(child:Session)
OPTIONAL MATCH (parent)-[:HAS_EVENT]->(e:DelegateAgentSpawnedEvent)
WHERE e.sub_session_id = child.node_id
RETURN child.node_id    AS child_session_id,
       child.started_at AS started_at,
       e.agent          AS agent,
       e.tool_call_id   AS tool_call_id
ORDER BY child.started_at
```

### Pattern 6: Session Overview

**Variant 1 — Flat summary (counts per session):**

```cypher
MATCH (s:Session {workspace: $workspace})
OPTIONAL MATCH (s)-[:HAS_EVENT]->(e:Event)
OPTIONAL MATCH (s)-[:HAS_TOOL_CALL]->(tc:ToolCall)
OPTIONAL MATCH (s)-[:HAS_FORK]->(child:Session)
RETURN s.node_id,
       s.started_at,
       s.status,
       count(DISTINCT e)     AS event_count,
       count(DISTINCT tc)    AS tool_call_count,
       count(DISTINCT child) AS child_session_count
ORDER BY s.started_at DESC
```

**Variant 2 — Breakdown by event category:**

```cypher
MATCH (s:Session {workspace: $workspace, node_id: $session_id})-[:HAS_EVENT]->(e:Event)
WITH e, [lbl IN labels(e) WHERE lbl ENDS WITH 'Event' AND lbl <> 'Event'] AS sub_labels
WHERE size(sub_labels) > 0
RETURN sub_labels[0] AS event_category,
       count(e)       AS event_count
ORDER BY event_count DESC
```

### Pattern 7: Parallel Tool Call Groups

**Variant 1 — Via ToolCall (structured path):**

```cypher
MATCH (s:Session {workspace: $workspace})-[:HAS_TOOL_CALL]->(tc:ToolCall)
WHERE tc.parallel_group_id <> ''
RETURN tc.parallel_group_id  AS parallel_group_id,
       collect(tc.tool_name) AS tool_names,
       count(tc)             AS group_size
ORDER BY group_size DESC
```

**Variant 2 — Via ToolPreEvent (flexible path):**

```cypher
MATCH (s:Session {workspace: $workspace})-[:HAS_EVENT]->(e:ToolPreEvent)
WHERE e.parallel_group_id <> ''
RETURN e.parallel_group_id  AS parallel_group_id,
       collect(e.tool_name) AS tool_names,
       count(e)             AS group_size
ORDER BY group_size DESC
```

**Variant 3 — Peak parallelism across workspace:**

```cypher
MATCH (s:Session:RootSession {workspace: $workspace})-[:HAS_TOOL_CALL]->(tc:ToolCall)
WHERE tc.parallel_group_id <> ''
WITH s.node_id AS session_id,
     tc.parallel_group_id AS grp,
     count(tc) AS grp_size
RETURN session_id,
       max(grp_size)       AS peak_parallelism,
       count(DISTINCT grp) AS parallel_group_count
ORDER BY peak_parallelism DESC
LIMIT 20
```

> **Note:** `parallel_group_id` is an empty string `""` (not null) when a tool runs
> alone. Use `tc.parallel_group_id <> ''` to filter parallel groups — not `IS NOT NULL`.

### Pattern 8: Search Prompt Text

`PromptSubmitEvent` nodes carry the `prompt` property (promoted by `PromptLifter`). Use
`PromptSubmitEvent` for submitted prompts and `PromptCompleteEvent` for completed ones.

**Basic search:**

```cypher
MATCH (e:PromptSubmitEvent {workspace: $workspace})
WHERE e.prompt CONTAINS $search_term
RETURN e.session_id, e.prompt, e.occurred_at
ORDER BY e.occurred_at DESC
```

**Case-insensitive search using `toLower()`:**

```cypher
MATCH (e:PromptSubmitEvent {workspace: $workspace})
WHERE toLower(e.prompt) CONTAINS toLower($search_term)
RETURN e.session_id, e.prompt, e.occurred_at
ORDER BY e.occurred_at DESC
```

### Pattern 9: Count Nodes by Label

```cypher
MATCH (n {workspace: $workspace})
RETURN labels(n) AS node_labels,
       count(n)   AS node_count
ORDER BY node_count DESC
```

Count a specific label type:

```cypher
MATCH (n:ToolCall {workspace: $workspace})
RETURN count(n) AS tool_call_count
```

### Pattern 10: Find Child Sessions of a Parent

**Variant 1 — Direct children only:**

```cypher
MATCH (parent:Session {workspace: $workspace, node_id: $session_id})-[:HAS_FORK]->(child:Session)
RETURN child.node_id    AS child_session_id,
       child.started_at AS started_at,
       labels(child)    AS session_labels
ORDER BY child.started_at
```

**Variant 2 — All descendants (any depth):**

```cypher
MATCH (parent:Session {workspace: $workspace, node_id: $session_id})-[:HAS_FORK*1..]->(descendant:Session)
RETURN descendant.node_id    AS descendant_session_id,
       descendant.started_at AS started_at,
       labels(descendant)    AS session_labels
ORDER BY descendant.started_at
```

### Pattern 11: Find Events Attached to a Session

```cypher
MATCH (s:Session {workspace: $workspace, node_id: $session_id})
      -[:HAS_EVENT]->(e:Event)
RETURN e.node_id    AS event_id,
       labels(e)    AS event_labels,
       e.occurred_at AS occurred_at
ORDER BY e.occurred_at
```

> **Note:** In Data Layer 1, all `HAS_EVENT` edges attach directly to the `Session` node. `ToolCall` nodes also carry `HAS_EVENT` edges for their `tool:pre` and `tool:post` events.

Via ToolCall:

```cypher
MATCH (s:Session {workspace: $workspace, node_id: $session_id})-[:HAS_TOOL_CALL]->(tc:ToolCall)-[:HAS_EVENT]->(e:Event)
RETURN tc.tool_name AS tool_name,
       tc.tool_call_id AS tool_call_id,
       e.event_name AS event_name,
       e.occurred_at AS occurred_at
ORDER BY e.occurred_at
```

### Pattern 12: Tool Activity Stats

`:ToolCall` nodes have no `status` property — derive success/failure from event types:
`tool:pre` = initiated, `tool:post` = completed, `tool:error` = failed.

**Per-tool event counts:**

```cypher
MATCH (s:Session {workspace: $workspace})-[:HAS_EVENT]->(e:ToolEvent)
RETURN e.tool_name, e.event_name, count(e) AS n
ORDER BY e.tool_name, e.event_name
```

**Tool error rate:**

```cypher
MATCH (s:Session {workspace: $workspace})-[:HAS_EVENT]->(e:ToolEvent)
WHERE e.event_name IN ['tool:post', 'tool:error']
RETURN e.tool_name,
       sum(CASE WHEN e.event_name = 'tool:error' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS errors,
       sum(CASE WHEN e.event_name = 'tool:post' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS successes
ORDER BY errors DESC
```

## New Patterns — Data Layer 1 Capabilities

The following patterns leverage Data Layer 1 graph nodes (`Session`, `Event`,
`ToolCall`, `HAS_FORK`, `HAS_EVENT`) and promoted event labels added by
PromptLifter, RecipeLifter, and other DL1 modules.

---

### N1: Delegation Tree

Traverse the full delegation chain from a root session to all its forked
descendants. Uses variable-length `HAS_FORK` traversal to build a complete
tree in one query.

```cypher
MATCH path = (root:Session {workspace: $workspace, node_id: $session_id})-[:HAS_FORK*1..]->(child:Session)
RETURN [n IN nodes(path) | n.node_id]  AS session_chain,
       [n IN nodes(path) | labels(n)]  AS label_chain,
       length(path)                    AS depth
ORDER BY depth, child.started_at
```

**Acceptance check** — count paths per delegation depth (no `$session_id`
needed; walk the whole workspace):

```cypher
MATCH path = (root:Session {workspace: $workspace})-[:HAS_FORK*1..]->(child:Session)
RETURN length(path) AS depth, count(*) AS paths_at_depth
ORDER BY depth
```

---

### N2: LLM Usage Per Session

#### (a) Per-model call counts

```cypher
MATCH (s:Session {workspace: $workspace})-[:HAS_EVENT]->(e:LlmResponseEvent)
RETURN e.model, e.provider, count(e) AS llm_calls
ORDER BY llm_calls DESC
```

#### (b) Session-level token summary

Token totals are surfaced by `OrchestratorCompleteEvent`, which fires once
at the end of each session.

```cypher
MATCH (s:Session {workspace: $workspace, node_id: $session_id})-[:HAS_EVENT]->(e:OrchestratorCompleteEvent)
RETURN e.total_input_tokens, e.total_output_tokens, e.turn_count, e.occurred_at
```

> **Discovery note:** token property names may differ across versions. Run
> `MATCH (e:OrchestratorCompleteEvent) RETURN keys(e) LIMIT 1` to confirm
> the exact property names available on your graph.

---

### N3: Recipe Progress

#### (a) Step-level iteration tracking

```cypher
MATCH (s:Session {workspace: $workspace})-[:HAS_EVENT]->(e:RecipeLoopIterationEvent)
RETURN e.recipe_name, e.step_id, e.iteration, e.occurred_at
ORDER BY e.occurred_at
```

#### (b) Recipe completion events

```cypher
MATCH (s:Session {workspace: $workspace})-[:HAS_EVENT]->(e:RecipeLoopCompleteEvent)
RETURN e.recipe_name, e.occurred_at, s.node_id AS session_id
ORDER BY e.occurred_at DESC
```

---

### N4: ToolCall Lifecycle

Retrieve all events attached to a specific `ToolCall` node in chronological
order.  Each tool invocation gets its own `:ToolCall` node with `HAS_EVENT`
edges to `tool:pre`, `tool:post`, or `tool:error` events.

```cypher
MATCH (tc:ToolCall {workspace: $workspace, node_id: $tool_call_node_id})-[:HAS_EVENT]->(e:Event)
RETURN e.event_name, e.occurred_at
ORDER BY e.occurred_at
```

**Acceptance check** — browse tool events without a specific node ID:

```cypher
MATCH (tc:ToolCall {workspace: $workspace})-[:HAS_EVENT]->(e:Event)
RETURN tc.tool_name, e.event_name, e.occurred_at
LIMIT 5
```

---

### N5: Event-Type Distribution

Count every distinct event type across all sessions to understand what
activities are most frequent in the workspace.

```cypher
MATCH (s:Session {workspace: $workspace})-[:HAS_EVENT]->(e:Event)
RETURN e.event_name, count(*) AS n
ORDER BY n DESC
```

---

## Graph Algorithm Examples

### Shortest Path Between Two Nodes

Find the shortest undirected path between any two nodes by `node_id`:

```cypher
MATCH (a {node_id: $source_id, workspace: $workspace}),
      (b {node_id: $target_id, workspace: $workspace}),
      path = shortestPath((a)-[*]-(b))
RETURN [n IN nodes(path)         | n.node_id]  AS node_chain,
       [r IN relationships(path) | type(r)]    AS rel_chain,
       length(path)                            AS hop_count
```

### All Paths from Session to a Specific Tool Execution

```cypher
MATCH (s:Session {node_id: $session_id, workspace: $workspace}),
      (tc:ToolCall {node_id: $tool_call_id, workspace: $workspace}),
      path = (s)-[*]->(tc)
RETURN [n IN nodes(path) | n.node_id]          AS path_nodes,
       [r IN relationships(path) | type(r)]    AS rel_types,
       length(path)                            AS depth
ORDER BY depth
LIMIT 10
```

### Variable-Length Traversal (Descendant Subgraph)

Walk up to 6 hops outward from a session to find all reachable nodes:

```cypher
MATCH (s:Session {node_id: $session_id, workspace: $workspace})
      -[:HAS_EVENT | HAS_TOOL_CALL | HAS_FORK*1..6]->(descendant)
RETURN descendant.node_id AS node_id,
       labels(descendant)  AS node_labels,
       descendant.occurred_at AS occurred_at
ORDER BY descendant.occurred_at
```

Walk the delegation lineage (any depth):

```cypher
MATCH path = (root:Session {workspace: $workspace})-[:HAS_FORK*1..]->(descendant:Session)
RETURN [n IN nodes(path) | n.node_id] AS session_chain,
       length(path)                   AS depth
ORDER BY depth
LIMIT 50
```

## Usage via graph_query Tool

### Bootstrap Queries

Use these queries to verify graph connectivity and explore session data.

#### Health check

```cypher
MATCH (s:Session) RETURN count(s) AS session_count
```

#### Recent sessions

```cypher
MATCH (s:Session {workspace: $workspace})
RETURN s.node_id AS session_id, s.started_at, labels(s) AS session_labels
ORDER BY s.started_at DESC
LIMIT 10
```

#### Tool calls for a session

```cypher
MATCH (s:Session {workspace: $workspace, node_id: $session_id})-[:HAS_TOOL_CALL]->(tc:ToolCall)
RETURN tc.tool_name, tc.started_at, tc.ended_at
ORDER BY tc.started_at
```

#### Child sessions

```cypher
MATCH (s:Session {workspace: $workspace, node_id: $session_id})-[:HAS_FORK]->(child:Session)
RETURN child.node_id AS child_session_id, child.started_at, labels(child) AS labels
ORDER BY child.started_at
```

---

All patterns above are executed through the `graph_query` tool. Pass a Cypher
query string as the first argument; the tool handles workspace scoping and
returns results as a list of row dicts.

Basic usage — find sessions in the current workspace:

```
graph_query(
  "MATCH (s:Session {workspace: $workspace}) "
  "RETURN s.node_id, s.occurred_at ORDER BY s.occurred_at DESC"
)
# Returns: list of dicts, one per row
```

With additional parameters — find tool events for a specific session:

```
graph_query(
  "MATCH (s:Session {workspace: $workspace, node_id: $session_id})"
  "-[:HAS_EVENT]->(e:ToolPreEvent) "
  "RETURN e.tool_name AS tool_name, e.occurred_at AS started_at",
  params={"session_id": "6afb3613-7041-4735-9c0f-c2171452ed18"}
)
```

Query another workspace explicitly:

```
graph_query(
  "MATCH (s:Session {workspace: $workspace}) RETURN s.node_id",
  workspace="project-alpha"
)
```

Cross-workspace query (wildcard — no `$workspace` injected):

```
graph_query(
  "MATCH (s:Session) "
  "RETURN s.workspace AS ws, count(s) AS session_count "
  "ORDER BY session_count DESC",
  workspace="*"
)
```

> **Note:** `graph_query` operates on the **persisted (flushed) store only**.
> In-memory buffered writes are not visible to Cypher queries until the store
> has been flushed. Use `get_node()` / `get_edge()` for buffer-aware reads.

---

## ID Format Reference

### Session nodes

Session `node_id` is the raw UUID from the Amplifier session. No
transformation is applied — the UUID is used directly:

```
55c8841a-1234-4abc-8def-000000000001
```

### All other nodes

Non-session nodes follow the pattern `{session_id}__{event_name}__{epoch_ms}`,
using `__` (double underscore) as the separator:

```
55c8841a-1234-4abc-8def-000000000001__prompt_submit__1737972001000
55c8841a-1234-4abc-8def-000000000001__tool_pre__1737972005000
55c8841a-1234-4abc-8def-000000000001__execution_start__1737972000000
```

Parsing the ID:

```python
# Split on double underscore separator
parts = node_id.split("__")
# parts[0] = session_id UUID
# parts[1] = event_name (colons replaced with underscores)
# parts[2] = epoch_ms as string
```

### ToolCall nodes

`ToolCall` node IDs use a three-segment format. Unlike `Event` nodes, there is
no epoch_ms timestamp — the `tool_call_id` is the third segment:

```
55c8841a-1234-4abc-8def-000000000001__tool_call__call_abc123
```

Parsing the ID:

```python
# Split on double underscore separator
parts = node_id.split("__")
# parts[0] = session_id UUID
# parts[1] = "tool_call" (literal)
# parts[2] = tool_call_id (provider-assigned correlation ID)
```

### Relationship identity

Relationships have no stored ID property. Identity is composite:
`(source.node_id, target.node_id, type(r))`. To locate a specific
relationship, match by endpoint `node_id` values and relationship type.

---

## Critical Gotchas

### 1. `metadata` is a JSON string, not a map

Node `metadata` properties are stored as JSON-encoded strings. You cannot
filter on nested fields directly in Cypher. Parse them in application code
after retrieving:

```cypher
// Correct — retrieve and parse in code
MATCH (s:Session {workspace: $workspace})
RETURN s.node_id, s.metadata
```

Do **not** attempt `s.metadata.some_key` — Cypher will return `null`.

### 2. Silently dropped events

Events written during the same millisecond with identical `node_id` values
are silently deduplicated on `MERGE`. If two events share `session_id`,
`event_name`, and `timestamp_ms`, only the first is stored. Use
`tool_call_id` (present on `ToolCall` nodes) to disambiguate parallel
tool calls.

### 3. No ordering guarantee on HAS_EVENT edges

`HAS_EVENT` edges carry no sequence number. When retrieving events for a session,
always use `ORDER BY e.occurred_at` to get chronological order:

```cypher
MATCH (s:Session {workspace: $workspace, node_id: $session_id})-[:HAS_EVENT]->(e:Event)
RETURN e.node_id, e.event_name, e.occurred_at
ORDER BY e.occurred_at ASC
```

### 4. Workspace scoping is manual

`graph_query` injects `$workspace` automatically, but only if you reference
`$workspace` in your query. Omitting the filter from a MATCH clause silently
returns data from **all** workspaces. Always include `{workspace: $workspace}`
on the anchor node of every query.

### 5. `HAS_EVENT` attaches directly to Session in DL1

All `HAS_EVENT` edges go directly from `Session` to `Event` — there is no
intermediate run-level node. `ToolCall` nodes also carry `HAS_EVENT` edges
to events scoped to that tool call. There is no run-level event routing in DL1.

### 6. Node `MERGE` key is `{node_id, workspace}`

All nodes are upserted using `MERGE (n {node_id: $node_id, workspace: $workspace})`.
Querying by `node_id` alone (without `workspace`) may match nodes from
other workspaces in a shared database. Always include `workspace` in
identity lookups.

---

## Notes

### Properties vs labels

Labels are separate from properties. You can filter on both:

```cypher
// Filter by label AND property
MATCH (s:RootSession {workspace: $workspace})
RETURN s.node_id

// Filter by property only (scans more nodes)
MATCH (n {workspace: $workspace})
WHERE 'RootSession' IN labels(n)
RETURN n.node_id
```

Prefer label-based filters — they use index-backed label scans and are faster
than property-only filters.

### Multi-label nodes

Nodes carry both a base label and a sub-type label. Both can be used in MATCH:

```cypher
// Matches any Session regardless of subtype
MATCH (s:Session {workspace: $workspace}) ...

// Matches only root sessions (both labels present)
MATCH (s:Session:RootSession {workspace: $workspace}) ...

// Equivalent WHERE form
MATCH (s:Session {workspace: $workspace})
WHERE s:RootSession ...
```

### Workspace property on relationships

Relationships also carry `workspace`. For cross-workspace queries where
you traverse relationships, add a relationship filter if needed:

```cypher
// workspace="*"
MATCH (s:Session)-[r:HAS_FORK]->(child:Session)
WHERE r.workspace = $target_workspace
RETURN s.node_id, child.node_id
```

### Buffer visibility

`graph_query` runs against the **persisted state only**. Nodes and
relationships buffered via `upsert_node`/`upsert_edge` but not yet flushed
will **not** appear in Cypher query results. Always flush before running
analysis queries when you need up-to-date results.

---

## Foundational Traversal Primitive

Data Layer 1 exposes three relationship types from a `Session` node. Use
`OPTIONAL MATCH` to combine all three in a single query:

```cypher
MATCH (root:Session {node_id: $session_id, workspace: $workspace})
OPTIONAL MATCH (root)-[:HAS_EVENT]->(e:Event)
OPTIONAL MATCH (root)-[:HAS_TOOL_CALL]->(tc:ToolCall)
OPTIONAL MATCH (root)-[:HAS_FORK*1..]->(child:Session)
RETURN
  count(DISTINCT e)     AS event_count,
  count(DISTINCT tc)    AS tool_call_count,
  count(DISTINCT child) AS child_session_count
```

For deep delegation tree traversal (all descendant sessions, capped at 20 hops):

```cypher
MATCH (root:Session {node_id: $session_id, workspace: $workspace})
      -[:HAS_FORK*1..20]->(descendant:Session)
RETURN descendant.node_id AS session_id,
       labels(descendant)  AS labels
ORDER BY descendant.started_at
```

**Note:** `parallel_group_id` is an empty string `""` (not null) when a tool
runs alone. Use `tc.parallel_group_id <> ""` to isolate parallel groups — not
`IS NOT NULL`.

---

## Time-Activity Queries

> All queries below use **Data Layer 1** constructs only: `Session:RootSession`,
> `HAS_EVENT`, `ExecutionStartEvent`, and `ExecutionEndEvent`.
> See [Data Layer 2 Warning](#data-layer-2-warning) for labels and relationship
> types that have no edges in the live graph and will return zero results.

**Why `started_at <= T`:** For a session to be active at instant T, it must
have started at or before T and not yet ended.

### 1. Session-Level: Active Sessions at a Point in Time

Root sessions that were active at a specific instant. Uses `started_at` and
`ended_at` properties on the `Session` node (populated by `session:start` and
`session:end` events).

```cypher
MATCH (s:Session:RootSession {workspace: $workspace})
WHERE s.started_at <= $point_in_time
  AND (s.ended_at IS NULL OR s.ended_at >= $point_in_time)
RETURN s.node_id    AS root_session_id,
       s.started_at AS root_started,
       s.ended_at   AS root_ended
ORDER BY s.started_at DESC
```

### 2. Session-Level: Sessions in a Time Range

Root sessions that started within a time window [t1, t2]:

```cypher
MATCH (s:Session:RootSession {workspace: $workspace})
WHERE s.started_at >= $t1 AND s.started_at <= $t2
RETURN s.node_id    AS root_session_id,
       s.started_at AS root_started,
       s.ended_at   AS root_ended
ORDER BY s.started_at DESC
```

### 3. Turn-Level: Execution Brackets Within a Session

Each user turn produces an `ExecutionStartEvent` and (when complete) an
`ExecutionEndEvent`. Use these to find turn boundaries within a specific
session:

```cypher
MATCH (s:Session {workspace: $workspace, node_id: $session_id})-[:HAS_EVENT]->(start:ExecutionStartEvent)
OPTIONAL MATCH (s)-[:HAS_EVENT]->(end:ExecutionEndEvent)
WHERE end.occurred_at > start.occurred_at
WITH start, min(end.occurred_at) AS turn_ended
RETURN start.node_id      AS bracket_id,
       start.occurred_at  AS turn_started,
       turn_ended,
       duration.between(datetime(start.occurred_at), datetime(turn_ended)) AS duration
ORDER BY start.occurred_at
```

### 4. Sessions with Any Turn in a Time Window

Find root sessions that had at least one execution turn start within [t1, t2]:

```cypher
MATCH (s:Session:RootSession {workspace: $workspace})-[:HAS_EVENT]->(e:ExecutionStartEvent)
WHERE e.occurred_at >= $t1 AND e.occurred_at <= $t2
RETURN DISTINCT
  s.node_id    AS root_session_id,
  s.started_at AS root_started,
  count(e)     AS turns_in_window
ORDER BY root_started DESC
```

## Recipe Analytics

> **DL1 Note:** In Data Layer 1, recipe data is captured as `RecipeLoopIterationEvent`
> and `RecipeLoopCompleteEvent` nodes. There is no dedicated recipe wrapper node.

**1. Sessions That Ran a Recipe** (via `RecipeLoopIterationEvent`):

```cypher
MATCH (s:Session {workspace: $workspace})-[:HAS_EVENT]->(e:RecipeLoopIterationEvent)
RETURN DISTINCT s.node_id AS session_id, s.started_at,
       e.recipe_name
ORDER BY s.started_at DESC
```

**2. Recipe Progress for a Session** (`recipe_name`, `step_id`, `iteration`, `occurred_at`):

```cypher
MATCH (s:Session {node_id: $session_id, workspace: $workspace})
      -[:HAS_EVENT]->(e:RecipeLoopIterationEvent)
RETURN e.recipe_name, e.step_id, e.iteration, e.occurred_at
ORDER BY e.occurred_at
```

**3. Recipe Completion Events** (via `RecipeLoopCompleteEvent`):

```cypher
MATCH (s:Session {workspace: $workspace})-[:HAS_EVENT]->(e:RecipeLoopCompleteEvent)
RETURN s.node_id AS session_id,
       e.recipe_name,
       e.occurred_at AS completed_at,
       e.status
ORDER BY e.occurred_at DESC
```

**4. Recipe Duration** (start to complete, joining iteration and complete events):

```cypher
MATCH (s:Session {node_id: $session_id, workspace: $workspace})
      -[:HAS_EVENT]->(iter:RecipeLoopIterationEvent)
MATCH (s)-[:HAS_EVENT]->(done:RecipeLoopCompleteEvent)
WHERE iter.recipe_name = done.recipe_name
RETURN iter.recipe_name,
       min(iter.occurred_at) AS recipe_started,
       done.occurred_at      AS recipe_completed
```

> **Note:** Cypher implicitly groups by non-aggregated columns — no explicit
> `GROUP BY` needed. If `occurred_at` is stored as a Neo4j `datetime` type,
> you can wrap both values in `duration.between()` to compute elapsed time.

**5. Loop Iteration Count per Recipe** (count and max iteration reached, grouped by recipe + step):

```cypher
MATCH (s:Session {workspace: $workspace})-[:HAS_EVENT]->(e:RecipeLoopIterationEvent)
RETURN e.recipe_name,
       e.step_id,
       count(e)         AS total_iterations,
       max(e.iteration) AS max_iteration_reached
ORDER BY total_iterations DESC
```

---

## Parallelism Degree

When the orchestrator fires multiple tool calls at once, each concurrent call
shares the same `parallel_group_id` (a UUID string). Tool calls that run alone
get `parallel_group_id = ""` (empty string — **never null**). Always filter
with `<> ""`, never with `IS NOT NULL`.

**1. Parallel groups for a session — via ToolCall (structured path):**

```cypher
MATCH (s:Session {workspace: $workspace, node_id: $session_id})-[:HAS_TOOL_CALL]->(tc:ToolCall)
WHERE tc.parallel_group_id <> ""
RETURN tc.parallel_group_id,
       collect(tc.tool_name) AS tools,
       count(tc)             AS parallel_degree
ORDER BY parallel_degree DESC
```

**2. Parallel groups for a session — via ToolPreEvent (flexible path, includes tool_input):**

```cypher
MATCH (s:Session {workspace: $workspace, node_id: $session_id})-[:HAS_EVENT]->(e:ToolPreEvent)
WHERE e.parallel_group_id <> ""
RETURN e.parallel_group_id,
       collect(e.tool_name)  AS tools,
       collect(e.tool_input) AS tool_inputs,
       count(e)              AS parallel_degree
ORDER BY parallel_degree DESC
```

**3. Peak parallelism across workspace — via Session:RootSession and HAS_TOOL_CALL:**

```cypher
MATCH (s:Session:RootSession {workspace: $workspace})-[:HAS_TOOL_CALL]->(tc:ToolCall)
WHERE tc.parallel_group_id <> ""
WITH s.node_id AS session_id, tc.parallel_group_id AS grp, count(tc) AS grp_size
RETURN session_id,
       max(grp_size)          AS peak_parallelism,
       count(DISTINCT grp)    AS parallel_groups
ORDER BY peak_parallelism DESC LIMIT 20
```

**4. Delegation parallelism — parallel agent spawns via DelegateAgentSpawnedEvent:**

```cypher
MATCH (s:Session {workspace: $workspace, node_id: $session_id})-[:HAS_EVENT]->(e:DelegateAgentSpawnedEvent)
WHERE e.parallel_group_id <> ""
RETURN e.parallel_group_id,
       collect(e.agent)          AS agents,
       collect(e.sub_session_id) AS sub_sessions,
       count(e)                  AS parallel_degree
ORDER BY parallel_degree DESC
```

## Token Efficiency

> **In Data Layer 1, token data lives on event nodes.** `LlmResponseEvent` nodes carry
> `model` and `provider` (via `LlmLifter`). Token counts may be at top level or in the
> `data` blob — run the discovery queries below to confirm what is available in your graph.

---

### 1. Discovery: What Token Properties Exist

Run these two queries first to confirm which properties are present on your graph before
writing any aggregation queries.

**OrchestratorCompleteEvent properties:**

```cypher
MATCH (e:OrchestratorCompleteEvent {workspace: $workspace})
RETURN keys(e) AS properties
LIMIT 3
```

**LlmResponseEvent properties:**

```cypher
MATCH (e:LlmResponseEvent {workspace: $workspace})
RETURN keys(e) AS properties
LIMIT 3
```

> **Confirmed property names** (from FieldLifter documentation and live graph):
> - `OrchestratorCompleteEvent`: `total_input_tokens`, `total_output_tokens`, `turn_count`
> - `LlmResponseEvent`: `model`, `provider` (lifted by `LlmLifter`); token counts may be in
>   the `data` blob — use `blob_read` + `jq` to extract them (see note at end of section).

---

### 2. Session-Level Token Summary

`OrchestratorCompleteEvent` fires once per session turn and carries cumulative token totals.
Use `Session` → `HAS_EVENT` → `OrchestratorCompleteEvent` to retrieve them.

```cypher
MATCH (s:Session {workspace: $workspace, node_id: $session_id})-[:HAS_EVENT]->(e:OrchestratorCompleteEvent)
RETURN e.total_input_tokens  AS total_input_tokens,
       e.total_output_tokens AS total_output_tokens,
       e.turn_count          AS turn_count,
       e.occurred_at         AS occurred_at
ORDER BY e.occurred_at
```

---

### 3. Per-Model Usage in a Session

`LlmResponseEvent` nodes carry `model` and `provider` (promoted by `LlmLifter`). Group by
both columns to break down LLM call counts per model within a session.

```cypher
MATCH (s:Session {workspace: $workspace, node_id: $session_id})-[:HAS_EVENT]->(e:LlmResponseEvent)
RETURN e.model    AS model,
       e.provider AS provider,
       count(e)   AS llm_calls
ORDER BY llm_calls DESC
```

---

### 4. Model Distribution Across Workspace

Same pattern as above but without the `node_id` filter — returns model usage across all
sessions in the workspace.

```cypher
MATCH (s:Session {workspace: $workspace})-[:HAS_EVENT]->(e:LlmResponseEvent)
RETURN e.model    AS model,
       e.provider AS provider,
       count(e)   AS llm_calls
ORDER BY llm_calls DESC
```

> **Extracting token counts from the data blob:** If `total_input_tokens` /
> `total_output_tokens` are null on `OrchestratorCompleteEvent` nodes, the raw values are
> stored in the `data` blob. Use `blob_read` to resolve the `ci-blob://` URI on the `data`
> property, then use `jq` to extract the token fields:
>
> ```
> # 1. Get the data blob URI
> graph_query("MATCH (s:Session {workspace: $workspace, node_id: $session_id})
>              -[:HAS_EVENT]->(e:OrchestratorCompleteEvent)
>              RETURN e.data LIMIT 1")
>
> # 2. Resolve and inspect with jq
> blob_read("ci-blob://...")  # returns local file path
> bash("jq '.total_input_tokens, .total_output_tokens' /path/to/blob")
> ```
